---------------------------------------

Streamy is a program that takes text input and generates Core MIDI messages.
To build Streamy, you should be able to just type 'make'.

Streamy reads lines from the standard input and produces no output on the
console.  Streamy expects output that is formatted like the output of MIDIShark
(https://github.com/usrbinnc/midishark).  We expect Streamy to mostly be used
with MIDIShark.

To run Streamy, type

$>midishark capture | midishark format | Streamy <number of MIDI instruments>


Input Format
-----------
A line of input for Streamy has 4 fields
<instrument> <velocity> <duration> <tones>

<instrument> is the MIDI bus that Streamy sends a command to
<velocity> is the velocity of the MIDI command
<duration> is the time (in ms) between when Streamy sends a 'note on' command
           and a 'note off' command
<tones> is a comma separated list of MIDI tone numbers (from, e.g., here:
        http://www.phys.unsw.edu.au/jw/notes.html)

Configuring MIDI
----------------
You can route Streamy's MIDI events in a MIDI performance rack program, like
MainStage.  To route them, you should create a virtual MIDI port for each
instrument on the OSX IAC Driver.  Once they are created, Streamy will talk to
them by number -- the first port in the list is 0, the second is 1, and so on.
Configured IAC ports will show up as MIDI sources in your MIDI rack program.
You can assign a port to drive an instrument and when Streamy sends messages to
that port it will play that instrument.
